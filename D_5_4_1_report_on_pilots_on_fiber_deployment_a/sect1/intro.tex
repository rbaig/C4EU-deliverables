\IEEEPARstart{S}{uper} WiFi is an emerging attempt to make use of the available spectrum in the UHF TV band (between $471.25$ and $863.25$~MHz) for wireless data transmissions. This spectrum availability is the result from the digital switchover of analog TV channels, allowing more TV data to be transmitted over the same $8$~MHz-width UHF TV channel.

Some of the benefits of attempting transmission over these frequencies are longer ranges and better building penetration than in the unlicensed $2.4$ and $5$~GHz bands used by the IEEE~$802.11$ set of protocols. These benefits are followed by strict regulatory and technological challenges regarding the administration of TV White Spaces (TVWS) and cognitive capabilities for incumbent avoidance.

%This report assesses some of Super WiFi's technical challenges, specially those related to incumbent detection and avoidance~\cite{shellhammer2009technical}. As a result, an energy detector on the UHF TV band is implemented using the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) Ettus USRP-E110~\cite{ettusUSRPE110} as a radio front end for embedded applications (see Figure~\ref{fig:usrp_combined}) and the open source Software Defined Radio (SDR) project GNURadio~\cite{GNURadio}. Furthermore, an instant image of the TV UHF band is derived from the detection (see Figure~\ref{fig:tvChannels}).

%Section~\ref{sec:related_work} overviews previous work in this area, followed by Section~\ref{sec:implementation} which details the implementation of a spectrum sensor using the USRP-E110. Results are summarized in Section~\ref{sec:results} while conclusions and future directions are provided in Section~\ref{sec:conclusions}.
