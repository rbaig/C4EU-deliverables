% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.

% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.



%\usepackage{hyperref}


% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
   \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize,caption=false]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )


% correct bad hyphenation here
\hyphenation{op-tical net-works semi-conduc-tor}


\begin{document}
%
% paper title
% can use linebreaks \\ within to get better formatting as desired
\title{Building a BuB Community \\ (C4EU 5.5.1: Report on support actions - training and networking)}
%
%
% author names and IEEE memberships
% note positions of commas and nonbreaking spaces ( ~ ) LaTeX will not break
% a structure at a ~ so this keeps an author's name from being broken across
% two lines.
% use \thanks{} to gain access to the first footnote area
% a separate \thanks must be used for each paragraph as LaTeX2e's \thanks
% was not built to handle multiple paragraphs
%

\author{
	Name~Name, %\IEEEmembership{Member,~IEEE,}
    and~Name~Name% \IEEEmembership{Life~Fellow,~IEEE}% <-this % stops a space
\thanks{
Affiliation
}
}


% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks - 
% these prevent an unwanted space from occurring between the last author name
% and the end of the author line. i.e., if you had this:
% 
% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.



% The paper headers
\markboth{C4EU 5.1.2: Report on Selection of Opportunities and Projects -b}%
{C4EU 5.1.2: Report on Selection of Opportunities and Projects -b}
% The only time the second header will appear is for the odd numbered pages
% after the title page when using the twoside option.
% 
% *** Note that you probably will NOT want to include the author's ***
% *** name in the headers of peer review papers.                   ***
% You can use \ifCLASSOPTIONpeerreview for conditional compilation here if
% you desire.




% If you want to put a publisher's ID mark on the page you can do it like
% this:
%\IEEEpubid{0000--0000/00\$00.00~\copyright~2007 IEEE}
% Remember, if you use this you must call \IEEEpubidadjcol in the second
% column for its text to clear the IEEEpubid mark.



% use for special paper notices
%\IEEEspecialpapernotice{(Invited Paper)}




% make the title area
\maketitle


\begin{abstract}
%\boldmath
This is the abstract
\end{abstract}
% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the journal you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals frown on math
% in the abstract anyway.

% Note that keywords are not normally used for peerreview papers.

\section{Mentor program and academic advice}
The students selected to participate in the Commons for Europe (C4EU) project do so as part of their education at the university.
Specifically, this training is divided in two different blocks: \emph{practicum} and \emph{degree thesis}.
The practicum involves real-world work in which the students have the opportunity to use the skills they have learned in regular courses.
It is also the opportunity to realize that real-world work is far away from the courses taught at the university, which means that the students have to make an extra effort to get acquainted with technologies and work-flows that they have not learned in class.

The \emph{practicum} is not a controlled environment as the course lab assignments are.
Things can go wrong, and it is important to understand and accept it.
Furthermore, there is not a teacher that \emph{knows the solution}.
This means that the level of effort to achieve results is much higher in the practicum than in a course assignment, as it is possible to get stuck and it may take days or longer to find a solution or a workaround.
The effort is measured in the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS).
The \emph{practicum} has a value of 20 ECTS credits, which is equivalent to 400 hours of work.

The students are not alone in this quest.
A \emph{mentor} is assigned to each student to indicate the tasks that the student has to do and provide the necessary help and guidance.
As the practicum is tied to a real-world work, the \emph{mentor} needs to be someone that has been working in this real-world for some time.

Besides the actual technical skills acquired in the execution of the \emph{practicum}, the students are also expected to practice \emph{soft} skills such as participation in meetings, effective communication, organization of work to meet schedules, generation of documentation, etc.
For some people, the practicum can be the starting point of a professional career.

In the next months, we will assign a mentor to each of the student participating in the C4EU project.
It is important that the mentor is someone from outside the university that is very familiar with bottom-up-broadband and with the pilot.
We have already taken the decision for two students:
\begin{itemize}
\item Nacho Justel will be mentored by Giovanni Calcerano in the FreeEuropeWiFi pilot.
\item Jorge Beltran will be mentored by Roger Baig in the fiber-from-the-home (FFTH) pilot.
\end{itemize}

In addition to the \emph{practicum}, the students also have write their \emph{degree thesis}.
This thesis is an academic document that is necessary to obtain the degree.
In the thesis, the students will comprehensively describe their pilot.
As an academic document, it has to be carefully written, well structured and profusely documented.
It is necessary to include introductory material, related work and references.
It is also important to include a detailed work-plan with descriptions of the tasks.
The work should be described in such a way that an external evaluator can understand what is the contribution and why it is important.

The \emph{thesis} has also a value of 20 ECTS credits, which means 400 additional hours of work.
This part of the work will be supervised by an academic advisor from the university.
There is hard deadline for the \emph{thesis} in June.
Not meeting this deadline would represent a delay of one year in the obtention of the degree.
For this reason, it may be a good idea to plan the work in such a way that the thesis is finished considerably earlier, to have some \emph{safety margin} in case of unexpected events.

\LaTeX\  is a popular document preparation system in the academia, that we will also use in the preparation of the thesis.
It is convenient to structure a large document in chapters, sections and subsection.
It also provides support for references and cross-references.
And automatically generates tables of contents, tables of figures, bibliography, etc.
Our idea is to use \LaTeX\ also for the preparation of the documentation of the C4EU project, in such a way that it can be re-used in the preparation of the thesis of the students.

Another tool that can be helpful in the preparation of the documentation is github.
Github is a web based extension of the git revision control system, and makes it possible that different people work in parallel on the same document, suggest changes, rollback modifications, etc. in a distributed fashion.

\subsection{Mentors for the OSN pilot}

Recently two researches joined the initiative and they will be helping Alejandro completing the project. A short biography is shown below.

\begin{description}
    \item[Alex Posada] He is an engineer who researches in the field of interactive media, produces and creates music and is actively involved in many interactive projects which normally involve sensors. Hence he will be able to contribute to the Open Sensor Network project.
    \item[TomÃ¡s DÃ­ez] He is the project manager in FabLab Barcelona ---workshop offering personal digital fabrication---, located in the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia (IAAC). He has executed projects in Latin America as well as in Europe. He focuses on the research for a more fluid language between machines and humans, and is currently working on Smart Citizen, a very similar initiative to Open Sensor Network.
\end{description}

\subsection{Mentor for the FFTx pilot}
The mentor for the FFTx pilot is Roger Baig Viñas and he will help Jorge Beltran to perform this project. Roger is from Barcelona and he studied Industrial and Electronic Engineering at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC). He also did a master at Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB). 
Now he is working in the Private Foundation guifi.net by the Open, Free and Neutral Network where he does tasks as international projects, dissemination and promotion. Roger also takes part in CONFINE (FP7) and C4EU (CIP) projects.


\subsection{Mentor for the FEW pilot}
As explained before, Nacho Justel will be guided by Giovanni Calcerano from Provicia WiFi.
Giovanni is graduated in Mathematics, and developed his carrer mostly as consultant in the field of high-level technical computing / scientific / statistical experience with over ten-year experience in the business sector. He is currently working at Provincia di Roma, being the responsably of European projects as OpenData, among others.
For more information, about his professional career, you can take a look at his LinkedIn profile.

\subsection{Mentor for the Mobile Node pilot}
Fernando, will be guided by Efra\'in Foglia. Efra\'in has been working in different areas related to Design and Art. Nowadays he is doing research on the field of the relation between Design \& Art and digital networks, taking into account also their social and political implications. He is an active member of guifi.net and exo.cat, two platforms which work on the design and deployment of open networks. 
\par 
He graduated in Design of Graphic Communication in UAM (Mexico) and is currently working on his PhD at the Universitat de Barcelona (UB) about "`\textit{Art in MediaCity}"'     


\section{BuB4EU Workshops}
Together with the mailing list, one of the main tools to exchange results and foster the discussion is the organization of workshops.
This workshops are announced on the mailing list and are open for everyone to participate.
There are two differentiated participation options: attendant and speaker.

The speakers are those that are more deeply involved in the project and prepare a short paper (one page) and some supporting slides for the talk.
The attendants simply listen and offer comments and feedback.

Each of the workshops has been organized by one of the members of the team.

\subsection{1st BuBEU workshop}

Date: July 24th.

Organizer: Jaume Barcelo

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Let the networks grow, let the knowledge flow}: It is an introduction both to the workshop and the BuB concept done by 							Jaume Barcelo.
	\item \textbf{Introduction to Open Sensors Network}: Describes the main objectives and issues that will affect the OSN Pilot, which is 					executed	by Alejandro Andreu.
	\item \textbf{C4EU Northern Quarter Network}: Describes the bases of the pilot and the main task which are planned to do. This pilot is 				implemented by Fernando Gros
	\item \textbf{CKAN: An Open Data Portal for Sensor Information Publication}: Describes what the CKAN tool is, and how is being 										implemented. This pilot is carried out by Manuel Palacin and Ivan Fernandez.
	\item \textbf{C4EU Rubi}: Describes the Rubi pilot, the tasks that have been done and the ones that needs to be done yet. This pilot is 				executed by Jorge Beltran
	\item \textbf{Spectrum Sensing with USRP}: Describes the progress on detecting TV White spaces using and USRP. This pilot is carried 							out by Luis Sanabria-Russo
	\item \textbf{Free Europe WiFi}: Describes the main aspects of the pilot and briefly analyzes some of the issues with which they will 						have to	deal with. This pilot is executed by Nacho Justel.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{2ond BuBEU workshop}

The second workshop, consisted of a set of presentations and demos that tried to show to the partners the current progress of each pilot.

Date: October 4th.

Organizer: Fernando Gros

The following are the papers that were presented: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Open Sensor Networks}: Alejandro Andreu
	\item \textbf{Key aspects and Main factors in NQN}: Fernando Gros
	\item \textbf{Practicum, Mentor, Thesis, Advisor}: Jaume Barcelo
	\item \textbf{FTTF/FTTP}: Jorge Beltran
	\item \textbf{Wireless Data Transmission with Ettus USRP-E110}: Luis Sanabria
	\item \textbf{OpenWISP Modules}: Nacho Justel 
\end{itemize}

Note that there have been some issues related to some of the pilots. The pilot C4EU Rubi has been canceled due to some problems with the city council. Therefore, Jorge Beltran will carry out the FTTF/FTTP instead. 

The C4EU NQN pilot has suffered some delays due to issues with the communication between the UPF and the MDDA. We will continue waiting for a reasonable time to see if that problems can be solved and the pilot can start.
 
\subsection{3rd BuBEU workshop}

At the third workshop were presented the project charters of the BuB projects that are carried out by UPF students. Also a new pilot were proposed. 

Let's review one by one the al the point from the workshop: 

Date: 19th November 2012

Organizer: Nacho Justel

Attendants: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Miquel Oliver 	\item Roger Baig
	\item Jaume Barcelo 	\item Adriana Marti
	\item Jorge Beltran 	\item Fernando Gros
	\item Alejandro Andreu 	\item Nacho Justel
	\item Pedro Vilchez 	
\end{itemize}

Talks:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Summary about Bologna C4EU meeting}: Miquel Oliver and Nacho Justel
	\item \textbf{FreeEurope WiFi Project Charter}: Nacho Justel 
	\item \textbf{Open Sensor Networks Project Charter}: Alejandro Andreu
	\item \textbf{FFTF/FFTP Project Charter}: Jorge Beltran	
	\item \textbf{Mobile Node Project Presentation}: Fernando Gros
	\item \textbf{New pilot proposal: Guifi.net structure for UPF}: Pedro Vilchez 
	\item \textbf{BuB C4EU web page status}: Adriana Martí
\end{itemize}

Due to some problems suffered about the communication between the UPF and the MDDA for the C4EU NQN pilot, Fernando will change his project to the before exposed Mobile Node project.

Fernando and Jaume will met Efraín Foglia (proponent of the project) to discuss the particularities about the Mobile Node project.


\section{Open mailing list}
One of the tools we use to communicate progress status, questions or just to maintain contact between the different people who make up this working group, is the list of emails. This list is completely open and free, so anyone who wants can sign up to receive it.

The list is provided by one of our partners, Guifi.net, and is accessible from the following link: https://lists.guifi.net/listinfo/bub. Are signed up to the list some components of this work team, partners and external stakeholders. We remark once again the full and complete opening thereof, to any person interested in the project. 

Any help, concern or comment is greatly appreciated and we urge all concerned to participate openly in him.

\section{Web}

Both \emph{Commons for Europe} and \emph{Code for Europe} have a webpage that present themselves to the world. For obvious reasons having a website is good and BuB should have one too. More people could be reached hence this kind of networks could become more popular.

This website should have a brief description explaining our goal as well as giving access to all the documents we work on, such as presentations, deliverables... A link to the mailing list would be adequate since individuals could be interested in becoming a part of this project. 

This website shall not be just a presentation letter but also have advanced functionalities for the parts already involved in it.

\section{International Forums}

\subsection{Battlemesh}

\subsection{International Summit of Wireless Community Networks}

The International Summit of Wireless Community Networks was performed in Barcelona between 4 and 7 of October 2012. The summit was a particular place where the participants could share your diverse knowledge and strategies about new technology infrastructure needs and formulating policy reforms to improve community wireless network. Three partners of our consortium participated in the event.


Ramon Roca spoke in the opening event, but also participated during all summit, first he informed all participants about the advantage of BuB business model against the traditional model - explaining why the BuB business model is better and he ended in agreement that infrastructure as a commons can be much more efficient, Ramon also explained the successful completion of the second phase of BuB fiber deployment in Gurb.


Miquel Oliver (as representative of Univesitat Pompeu Fabra, participant in the Bottom-up Broadband project) talked about the C4EU project, and especially about the BuB branch of the project. And Federico Capoano, from Caspur, presented about the need of creating accessible documentation for non-geeks.

And this is the conclusion.




% if have a single appendix:
%\appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]
% or
%\appendix  % for no appendix heading
% do not use \section anymore after \appendix, only \section*
% is possibly needed

% use appendices with more than one appendix
% then use \section to start each appendix
% you must declare a \section before using any
% \subsection or using \label (\appendices by itself
% starts a section numbered zero.)
